## Introduction
[Azure Bicep](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview?tabs=bicep) is a Resource Manager template language that's used to declaratively deploy Azure resources. Bicep is a domain-specific language, which means that it's designed for a specific scenario or "domain." Bicep isn't meant to be used as a standard programming language for writing applications. Bicep is used only to create Resource Manager templates. All resource types, API versions, and properties are valid in Bicep templates.
